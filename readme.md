- Data association.

we have user and post id. so based on id we can tell which user post is it.

ek model se dusre model ke data ko jod dena id ke through, means we have 1 user so that user will make the post jab post banega user hi bnaega so when 2 data are closely related then we add these data. ek model ke bane hue data ki id ko doosre model ke data to dedete han aur is model ki id ko dusre ke data ko de dete han.

post id to user
user id to post

npm i express-generator (setup it here.)
